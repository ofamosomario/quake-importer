# Case:

Create a project to parse the Quake log file.
The log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server, including a great deal of information of every match.

  **The project should implement the following functionalities:**
  

 - Read the log file
 - Group the game data of each match
 - Collect kill data

**Additional notes:**
 - When <world> kill a player, that player loses -1 kill score.
 - Since <world> is not a player, it should not appear in the list of players or in the dictionary of kills.
 - The counter total_kills includes player and world deaths.

# Usage
I created two ways to use this importer, you can use the http://localhost:3000 to access the user interface (this is a nice one user interface if you are a Quake fan ), or you can use the swagger file to send the request for the API
